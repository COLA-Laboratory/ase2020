## Introduction

Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), which borrows data from similar projects by combining a transfer learner with a classifier,have emerged as a promising way to predict software defects when the available data about the target project is insufficient. How-ever, developing such a model is challenge because it is difficult to determine the right combination of transfer learner and classifier along with their optimal hyper-parameter settings.  We propose a tool, BiLO-CPDP, which is the first of its kind to formulate the automated CPDP model discovery from the perspective of bi-level programming.  ![BiLO-CPDP](./BiLO-CPDP.png)
